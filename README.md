## Little bit about myself...
I'm a graduating senior studying physics and data science. I was always somewhat interested in environmental issues but during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I had the chance to explore more about it. The United States, between 2016 to 2020, openly neglected some of the serious green policies and some disasterous phenomena were labeled as "hoaxes." Then I got curious -- how can we, as a society, convince more people to participate in saving our planet. This project is my attempt to understand different opinions on climate change based on demographics and find efficient ways to have people get involved in conserving environment.

## Purpose
- To analyze how Americans think/feel about climate change depending on their gender, age, and political preference
- Identify popular and unpopular environmental-saving activities and green policies and reasons behind
- Investigate the respondants who filled out "unsure" to the free-response question asking if they can guess what the purpose of the survey is

### Storyboard
This file has the overview of my project. It does not provide any programming details on how I came to certain conclusions, yet it shows the answers and analysis to my questions.

### Notebook
In this file, you will find the programming portion of the project. I used the language Python, specifically the Pandas library, to sort and clean the dataset I obtained from Harvard Dataverse. To visualize, I used the Bokeh package. I added comments to most steps I took, so you can easily follow how I got to my conclusions.

### Survey
The survey used to collect the dataset is shown here. I added these questions in my Notebook for convenience as well.

### Dataset
The link to this dataset is: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/8Z7M4G. This is part of the research project done by Salomon, Preston, and Tannenbaum about the causes of peoplesâ€™ attitudes and beliefs about climate change in 2015.
