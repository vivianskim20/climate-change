## Little bit about me...
I'm a graduating senior studying physics and data science. I was always somewhat interested in environmental issues but during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I had the chance to explore more about it. The United States, between 2016 to 2020, openly neglected some of the serious green policies and some disasterous phenomena were labeled as "hoaxes." Then I got curious -- how can we, as a society, convince more people to participate in saving our planet. This project is my attempt to understand different opinions on climate change based on demographics and find efficient ways to have people get involved in conserving environment.
