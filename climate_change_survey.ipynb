I also checked the sample sizes per group and they are all large (> 5). However, the standard deviations (shown below) for each group is *very different* from one another, thus the third assumption is violated. In that case, the website suggested using a ***Kruskal-Wallis test***, a non-parametric version of the one-way ANOVA that compares the population **median** of all groups."

In my lecture notes from PBLHLTH 142, 2 sample T-test is best when sample sizes are both larger than 5 and it may require larger samples if the 2 populations have very different shape, besides them being SRS's. Even so, however, if the sample sizes are larger than 15, it's okay to use T procedures. Thus, I proceeded to conduct a T-test again here."
